# Stats-Final-Project
The data collection for my statistics final project.  It analyzes the likelihood of a successful terrorist attack based on the climate (political and economic) of the country it happened in.

The main file is very messy - the same style loop is repeated many times.  This was done in the interest of time - I spend too long studying for tests last week and I am very close to deadline.  I may go back through and clean up the file to be more readable.
